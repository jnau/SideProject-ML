# SideProject-ML

## Introduction

This is a repository for a new side project that I was thinking of. I will be implementing very basic and common machine learning algorithms using Python and possibly R. With those algorithms, I can apply them to larger data sets that are available to me. I will be keeping notes on the pros and cons of each method, as well as what I personally feel about using/implementing them.

## Basic 3 types of Machine Learning 

### Supervised Learning

### Unsupervised Learning 

### Reinforcement Learning
