# SideProject-ML

## Introduction

This is a repository for a new side project that I was thinking of. I will be implementing very basic and common machine learning algorithms using Python and possibly R. With those algorithms, I can apply them to larger data sets that are available to me. I will be keeping notes on the pros and cons of each method, as well as what I personally feel about using/implementing them.

## Basic 3 types of Machine Learning 

### Supervised Learning

### Unsupervised Learning 

### Reinforcement Learning

## Possible Project(s)
* Weightlifting Goal Calculator
- Are you on track to reach your goal?

Based on your training log, by the number of repetitions for a certain amount of weight, it can figure out whether you are on track to reach your goal for the three main lifts: Back Squats, Deadlift, and Bench Press.  

Refer to: https://strengthlevel.com/strength-standards/female/lb

By using the training log, StrengthLevel is able to calculate what your relative strength is compared to other people in the same age group, and gender. I will be trying to utilize this log to keep track of my lifts and warm-ups, as well as an Excel sheet. 

A long term goal of this project will be to take in your progress over a certain period of time and see if you will be able to reach a certain goal, possibly giving suggestions to your workouts based on what you've been doing and even a time frame. 

Although some assumptions are made. 

My personal goal, I want to be able to obtain 0.78x, 1.44x, & 1.19x of my body in Bench Press, Deadlift, and Back Squats. Currently, Bench: 0.5x, Deadlift: 1.38x, Back Squat: 1.19x. Will be collecting data.
